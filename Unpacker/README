This folder contains the software used to unpack the hld files.

They were written in Matlab by LIP-Coimbra.
There are two files, but actualy the main script calls the other.

In the main script the paths to the input data, output files and 
temp folder should be specified. 

The TRB number should be given. For example, if the data were taken 
using the TRB number 99:
 
   trbNumber = '099';
   TRBs = {[899],[1]};
