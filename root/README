This folder contains some examples of scripts analysis:
  * ana.C
  * drawHistos.C
  * readPars.C
   
-The main scrip, ana.C, must be compiled againts the Root libraries:

g++ ana.C -g -q -o <executable> ‘root-config --cflags --glibs‘

The produced executable needs a data file as input:

<executable>  Data

As a result, it produces a .root file with a collection of histograms 
and a text file with some parameters of interest.

-The drawHistos.C script only displays the histograms of the Root file
in a more comfortable way. The name of the input file is inside the 
script:
  // Open root file 
  TFile *file = new TFile("<Name of the Root file");

This script is not compiled, just type 

	root -l drawHistos.C
	
or just load and call the function inside Root:
   $ root -l
   > .L drawHistos.C
   > drawHistos()
   
- The readPars.C script just draws some of the parameters listed in the text file
produced by the main executable. As drawHistos.C, just call it or load in root.
